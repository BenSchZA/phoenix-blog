Just past Simonstown near a place called Miller's Point you will find one of the most primitive shark species around - the [Sevengill Cow Shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadnose_sevengill_shark Wikipedia link to Broadnose Sevengill Shark). South Africa is known for its Great Whites, but the other sharks seen in Shark Alley are just as impressive.

I have been a member of the UCT Underwater Club for the past 4 years and it is definitely my favourite dive site. As part of the committee of the UCT Underwater Club I was involved in the gear room with gear rental, maintenance, and as a compressor operator.

Some of the sharks I have seen at Shark Alley:

* Sevengill cowshark (Notorynchus cepedianus)
* Pyjama Shark (Poroderma africanum)
* Puffadder shyshark (Haploblepharus edwardsii)
* Spotted gully shark (Triakis megalopterus)

Check out the videos I took while diving there over the years - if that doesn't get you diving with the sharks of Shark Alley, then I'm not sure what will!
