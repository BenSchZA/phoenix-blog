Having studied mechatronics engineering,
I strive to be a polymath and love applying systems thinking when building context in a given problem space.

I've worked on both hardware and software product development, token engineering, full-stack
fintech application development, and DevOps for a number of projects.

I also love addressing the
challenges of developer experience, the software development pipeline, and practising as a developer
advocate - soft skills that have helped me as a project lead.

I maintain and contribute to a number of open-source projects, such as [Pier](https://github.com/BenSchZA/pier).
